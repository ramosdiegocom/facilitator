## 🎯 Quick Navigation

**I want to understand the design:**
→ Read `docs/CONTEXT.md`, then `docs/adr/MERGE_APP_DESIGN.md`

**I want to know what to build:**
→ Read `FILE_STRUCTURE_REFERENCE.md` for visual overview

**I want step-by-step instructions:**
→ Follow `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phases 1-9 in order

**I need to know database schema:**
→ Use `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md` (SQL + Drizzle)

**I want the quick success checklist:**
→ See `HANDOFF.md` section "Acceptance Gate"

**I'm stuck on a design decision:**
→ Check `docs/adr/MERGE_APP_DESIGN.md` for rationale

## ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before you start coding:

- [ ] I've read `HANDOFF.md` completely
- [ ] I've read `docs/CONTEXT.md` and understand the domain
- [ ] I've scanned `docs/adr/MERGE_APP_DESIGN.md` and noted the 25 decisions
- [ ] I've reviewed `FILE_STRUCTURE_REFERENCE.md` to see the file layout
- [ ] I understand the 9 phases in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
- [ ] I have `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md` open as reference
- [ ] I understand the acceptance gate (12 items that must pass)
- [ ] I know old apps get deleted only after Phase 9.3

## 🎓 How to Use These Docs

### During Phase 1-3 (Foundation)
- Keep `FILE_STRUCTURE_REFERENCE.md` open
- Reference `CONTEXT.md` for naming conventions
- Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for exact file paths

### During Phase 4-6 (Auth & Handlers)
- Use `DATABASE_MIGRATION_SPEC.md` for schema details
- Reference `docs/adr/MERGE_APP_DESIGN.md` Q7-9 for middleware decisions
- Check `CONTEXT.md` "Auth Models" for exact auth flow

### During Phase 7-9 (Testing & Gate)
- Use `HANDOFF.md` "Acceptance Gate" as checklist
- Reference `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` Phase 9 for exact commands
- Double-check against `docs/adr/MERGE_APP_DESIGN.md` Q15 (testing strategy)
